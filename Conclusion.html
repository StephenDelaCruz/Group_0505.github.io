<br>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 18px;"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="50px">G</font>overnment surveillance is a contentious topic in society 
    and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. The justification for the government to surveil its citizen’s has been largely 
    the same over its history, keeping the citizen’s safe. However it has looked drastically different over time, and across countries. 
    China has an approach that is considered nuclear in other countries controlling what is said, what is published, and even going so 
    far as to rate citazens to decide who gets access to certain privileges (Canales & Mok, 2022). Whereas New Zealand has a comparatively 
    much more relaxed system, the same intention remains, to keep citazens safe, however the questionability of it still remains, is it 
    right for a government to have access to an individuals private, files, conversations or images with the intention of only ever seeing 
    a small percent that belong to bad actors.</font></p>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 18px;"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="50px">N</font>ew Zealand’s governments form of surveillance isn’t as widely 
    condemned especially by the international community, especially when compared to China. This can ultimately due to the way the New 
    Zealand government governs itself, with regards to creating laws that it then hold itself accountable to, along with ensuring any 
    international agents acting within the country also abide by the laws that have been set, this gives the citazens of New Zealand a 
    sense that the power is not being abused. This was exemplified by the Kim Dotcom case, where agencies not associated with the NZ 
    government, were surveiling a resident of New Zealand illegally, resulting in the case falling a part due to the evidence provided 
    being considered tainted (Radio New Zealand, 2017).</font></p>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 18px;"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="50px">C</font>ontrary to this positive act by the government of maintaining 
    a moral high ground while letting a potential criminal get away with a crime. There are instances where a government actor doesn’t 
    necessarily, maintain its morality and the intention behind laws that it creates, such is the case of Snowden where the reality of 
    what data and techniques were being used by the government actor the NSA were leaked, leading to controversy surrounding the privacy 
    of not only U.S citazens but also citazens around the world (Mohamed, A 2021).</font></p>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 18px;"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="50px">T</font>here are still many questions yet to be answered, How far is 
    too far for a government to pry in order to save lives? How much does the individual care about their privacy? Should it be necessary 
    to take steps to have privacy, and not just have it assumed? All of which are important to the question is government surveillance good 
    or bad, and how far is too far when it comes to compromising privacy to the individual?</font></p>
