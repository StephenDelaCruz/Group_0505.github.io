<p style="font-size: 18px;"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="50px">W</font>hat is a government surveillance? According to the Search and Surveillance Act 
    of 2012 it is the act of observing actions or conversations of a group or individual. This can include the use of technology such as listening devices 
    inside of one’s home, monitoring web traffic, or even going under cover.  In places such as the United States there is the Patriot Act which allows the 
    government to spy individuals who are deemed to be a danger to the public. This act has been notorious for being abused by the government with the idea 
    of protecting the public while breaching the privacy of innocent individuals. In New Zealand we are lucky, there are very famous example of the government, 
    or government agencies holding itself accountable for breaching their own law, and allowing criminals free based on the fact not all of the procedures 
    were not followed, and the individual’s right to privacy was breached.</font></p>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 18px;"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="50px">G</font>overnment surveillance isn’t a unique issue to a 21st century society. Kings and 
    queens would have their most loyal followers report back on what was being said in secret. However, they didn’t have the ability to essentially enter 
    someone’s home through what the citizens thought was a private connection. Such as through the citizens browser history, or even telephoto lenses through 
    an open blind. The ability for the government to enter someone home without the knowing or ever physically being inside the home is a unique 21st century issue.</font></p>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 18px;"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="50px">G</font>overnments often have the façade that they are transparent, however often the transparency 
    only extends to what is convenient and not a hindrance.  For example, in NZ there is the ability to ask if you are under surveillance, there is not an obligation 
    for them to tell the truth, or give a real answer. Often the answer is vague or just a non-response. The ability to ask is a part of the illusion that the government 
    is not watching its citizens.</font></p>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 18px;"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="50px">G</font>overnment surveillance is one of the many things that feels inevitable when the almost 
    every citizen has a device that is capable of tracking their every moment, and at times, what feels like your thoughts. The surveillance is explained to be 
    helping the individual citizens by monitoring for bad actors who could harm the public. (Wired, 2017) as With 6/10 Americans believing that they can’t get through 
    daily life without the government collecting data on them (Pew Research Center, 2019). The question is raised, how far is too far? Is the right to privacy for an 
    individual worth more than the possibility of tracking a bad actor? The United Nations condemns mass spying as intrusive and ineffective. New Zealand has strong 
    laws that don’t allow the same level of surveillance of citizens, but how far are citizens willing to give up their privacy for the greater good?</font></p>
