<br>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 18px;"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="50px">T</font>he issue of government surveillance has been a point of heated debate in New 
    Zealand since the 2012 legislation from National party. Supporters for this practice argue that it is essential for the safety of civilians and uphold 
    national security standards by closely watching any possible signs of terrorism or organized crime activity. However, staunch adversaries contend that 
    governmental spying activities contravene personal privacy rights while propelling ethical issues concerning free speech and information autonomy forward 
    into the limelight. This composition will strive towards an ensemble exploration encompassing both hazard assessment associated with governmental 
    monitoring endeavours within New Zealand whilst simultaneously delving deep down into its consequential moral dilemmas too.</font></p>
<br>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 18px;" id="#P1"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="50px">I</font>n the year of 2012, a rather contentious bill was brought forth by the 
    government in New Zealand. This particular piece of legislation granted their main intelligence agency extended abilities to observe and scrutinize its 
    populace - ultimately inducing unease among both natives and inhabitants alike due to its invasive nature. (ABC News. 2012) The enactment of this legislation 
    ignited a fervid discussion centred on the equilibrium between ensuring national safety and preservation of personal privacy rights. Detractors expressed 
    their viewpoint that these invasive tactics were eroding civil freedoms and transgressing essential private liberties. The Government Communications Security 
    Bureau had also broken a law that prevents them from spying on New Zealand citizens and permanent residents, with a government report revealing that they 
    had been spying on at least 88 New Zealand residents over the past 10 years. The Prime Minster Jhon Key justified the GCSB actions by making vague comments 
    that this will prevent terrorist threats. (Tom, P. 2013) As a consequence, there was an extensive wave of antagonism as thousands of people protest against 
    these spying laws, “Thousands of people in 11 towns and cities across New Zealand attended protest rallies on July 27, 2012, against the conservative 
    National Party” (Tom, P. 2013) This also led to John Key loss in the subsequent general election held after one year from the establishment of this law.</font></p>
<br>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 18px;" id="#P2"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="50px">I</font>n light of New Zealand's membership in the Five Eyes, a comprehensive 
    intelligence alliance comprised of Australia, Canada United Kingdom and The United States, our citizens had unwittingly become subject to extensive 
    sharing operations involving their private information. After the illegal spying of New Zealand residents was revealed by the government, they had 
    disabled all their surveillance technologies. “The GCSB also told the High Court the "majority of selectors" were removed on January 24, 2012” 
    (David, F. 2017) but they found out that their surveillance systems were still active and spying on citizens without anyone from the New Zealand government 
    being aware of this. This was Because the NSA (National Security Agency) a foreign state was using our technology to spy on Kim Dotcom. That’s how much power 
    the Five Eyes alliance gave to foreign countries, they were able to bypass New Zealand’s authority and do as they pleased with GCSB’s technology. Now image 
    how much more information they were able to gather about New Zealand’s citizens as we only know that GCSB was only spying on 88 people. Before the 
    New Zealand government knew that the NSA was surveying people in NZ, they had aided the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) in the raid of New Zealand 
    resident house, Kim Dotcom. The New Zealand government have been making thing right by claiming damages over the unlawful spying on Dotcom. (David, F. 2017) 
    The government has also implemented a new privacy law in 2020 preventing this illegal spying from happening again, which insured that you would know when 
    your information is being collected, your information is used and shared appropriately, is kept safe and secure, and you can get access to your information. (Privacy Act, 2020)</font></p>
<br>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 18px;" id="#P2"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="50px">A</font>t the pinnacle of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was planned by the New Zealand government to institute a 
    mechanism for facial recognition in order to monitor and trace individuals within society. (Pennington, P. 2020) This ambitious undertaking involved drawing on information held within 
    citizens' drivers' licenses which would then be linked together with their documented proof of vaccination, also known as vaccine passports. Thankfully, this particular action plan 
    did not ultimately come into fruition; nonetheless governmental resources had already been allocated towards procuring this cutting-edge technology prior to its shelving resulting 
    in financial behind-the-scenes expenditures having been squandered pointlessly.</font></p>
<br>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 18px;" id="#P2"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="50px">I</font>n brief, the implementation of government surveillance entails a multitude of hazards and moral 
    predicaments which necessitate thoughtful deliberation by any democratic state such as New Zealand. The complexity lies in achieving harmony between safeguarding individual 
    liberties whilst simultaneously furnishing sufficient measures to counter jeopardies against society as a whole. This equilibrium can be attained through implementing candid 
    procedures underpinned with robust legal frameworks and vigilant monitoring apparatuses, promoting unrestricted communication regarding the role that surveillance plays in 
    contemporary existence, in addition to collaborating globally with like-minded democracies aiming for analogous resolutions - resulting in an ability to reach this precarious 
    balance while preserving essential principles upon which an open and liberated community is based.</font></p>
